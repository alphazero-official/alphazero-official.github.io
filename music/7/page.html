<b>UNDEFINABLE</b> is the seventh single released under alpha.zero and the third collaboration project between <i><a href="/about/1oolm.html">1oolm</a></i> and <i><a href="/about/masernerd.html">Stretched Across Infinity</a></i>.
<br><br>
The single was released digitally on March 8th, 2024 on 6 streaming platforms.

The track can be considered a detour from 1oolm's usual style of the time, featuring a lesser focus on hardcore drops, instead opting for a more experimental glitch and sampled flavor, derived from Stretched Across Infinity's contributions.
