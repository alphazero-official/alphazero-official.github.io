<h2>Trivia</h2>
<div id="line"><hr /></div><br>
<ul>
<li>The original iteration of this song was a hardcore track called <i>Bloodied Ice Cubes</i>. It hasn't gotten past the first drop in production, leading to tomorrowcave being salvaged out of the main melody.</li>
<li>This song was made entirely on a phone.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Background</h3>

<blockquote>
So, a week or two after Constraint's release, my laptop charger melts completely, voiding my PC privileges, then a few days later my phone suffers the same fate. We quickly bought a replacement phone, and I started working on the streaming releases that happened September 3rd.<br>
After that whole shebang, I got bored. So bored that I went back to my roots of FL Studio Mobile. I started off using this app back in Winter 2021-2022, and I haven't touched it since. For good reason! But alas, the devil's pitchfork had to be used.<br>
