Oops, it's been a while! I've had some bad days and whatever, and have mostly been focusing on other things, such as game work. Hope to get stuff out, we've been having fun ;]

Today I:
- Updated the site's font from Lucida Console to Roboto Mono. I think that makes more sense, it's the main font we use for alpha.zero, y'know.
- Added post dates to the /categories/ search page
