Yeah hey! Somehow I haven't given up and am making decent strides towards making this a proper experience.   
Today I:
- Got "About" pages for alpha.zero team members working
- Fixed file/image/etc. support (stupid oversight)
- Now know how to edit the 404 page and the base layouts
- Remembered the "author" field exists on post pages   
- Added Disqus comment support.
