EVEN MORE WORK. I did speedruns yesterday, so this took a bit.

Today I:
- Added a searchbar. Aligning it took 2 DAYS TOTAL.
- Stylised alpha.zero as &alpha;lpha.zero because it's funny
- //<font color="#DDDDDD">THE LINE</font>// now takes a percentage of the screen instead of a set amount of pixels, fixing appearance on mobile etc.
- Little changes here and there (About/Team organisation, etc.)
