Still working  

Today I:
- Slightly cleaned up the footer area
- Added more pages to the credits (contributors, acknowledgements and special thanks)
- Moved the Posts list from the home page to /posts
- Redid the backend of the staff list again (staff.yml + contributors.yml)
- Moved Masernerd to Contributors
- New home page w/randomised message. My first experience with JavaScript. Interesting for sure. I can do <font color="#00AA00"><span id="text"></span></font>
- Removed the "(subcribe <a href="{{ "/feed.xml" | relative_url }}">via RSS</a>)" message in the Posts page
- Added &copy; to the footer. Not sure how accurate that is, though. <br>Better check how copyright works! :P
