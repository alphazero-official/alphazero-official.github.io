Hi! Thanks for clicking the link, appreciate it.   
I don't even know where to begin. It's been over a year since my last public YouTube video, and it was an update to an update. I didn't want to do that same thing again and make a third video, so here we are, on my own site. That's one of the things I've done in the absence.   
Generally there's too much to talk about that's happened in the past year. As a 15 year old kid, 1 year is still a decent chunk of my life, especially considering the personal growth as of late.

Honestly, I don't think there's too much point in talking about the past, the memories have been blending together like a smoothie. I've reunited with some old friends lately, and the important thing has been to just keep making more memories. So that's what I'm gonna do.   
   
Let's test out the ability to have a platform of my own, with no cookies, no ads, nothing. Not even good web design!
I'll show you a work in progress demo of a track I'm working on. You can comment below.

Yeah, this is definitely not for everyone. Apologies to whoever's had their ears blown out, but that's just how I am right now. I'm sure things will change, but I'm currently sticking with doing mostly hardcore, because I enjoy making it. I've already said that in the first "where ive been" video from January 2022, where I showed some frankly horrible FL Studio Mobile recordings. I have no idea what was going through my head when I put that in, but I've certainly improved since then, and I hope you have too.

Now, for the future of the YouTube channel, and my general plans...<br>
I dunno! Been focusing on music as a break from game development, so I haven't worked on any games in a few months now. YouTube content doesn't seem that likely either. It's been several years, yet my standards remain the same: everything is "too minor and unimportant" to post. I've heard content creators like minor stuff a lot nowadays. I still don't.   
Basically, all that matters is that we're all not dead at all. If you're reading this, that is.

Let's ramble about random things now!   
<br>
Did you know that I got a new laptop last month? The previous one is over 11 years old now, and has been serving me well since 2018. It's time it takes a rest. Might be selling it soon, since money's important when I can't receive support from anyone here, but who knows, the sentimental value could overpower.   
The seller of this laptop is also a streamer. It was surreal coming in to pick it up and seeing an actual gaming setup with an RTX card and everything. This was his chat laptop, and damn it's good. I won't link his channel here due to privacy reasons, and basically everyone here speaking a foreign language he wouldn't understand much either. But thanks to him anyway, super nice deal, I'm happy so far.

Another fun thing: I went to a goddamn military factory the other week, and recorded some audio during the trip. Some footage of the plant is used in the track snippet I've shown in this post. Yes, I am that guy. I do weird things.

I hope you're still reading. As stupid as it sounds, I have indeed been losing faith in some people's attention spans, and I haven't been feeling confident about their desire to go on a completely individual website for updates on one guy's thingy, especially when it's boring in an almost formal way, almost no color anywhere, plain text all the way. My style here is literally business e-mail. Let me know how you feel about this in the comments.

Happy Halloween. I don't celebrate, but to whoever does, hope you had fun!   
Yeah, you can join my Discord server through the link on the footer below. I don't bite, too lonely for that.    
If you're really curious and have known me, feel free to shoot me a message. I might be able to tell you some tales in a more personal setting. 
<br><br>
See you soon! Peace out. <img src="/assets/image/AZ2022.png" style="float: right" width="100"/>
