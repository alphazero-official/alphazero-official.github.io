The alpha.zero official website has been officially launched to my official Discord server of my official audience.   
It's technically been public for weeks now, but not ready. But now it is! <br>
  
Here, me and the alpha.zero team can host information about the studio and its history, post updates, etc. Sure hope this won't die out as I forget to use it... welp, it's a personal website and my footprint on Internet history, that should be enough encouragement.

One advantage I can think of over using social media like Twitter or Tumblr is the absolute lack of bloat. Seriously. Check this shit out. <br><br>

<br><br>
The ENTIRE WEBSITE (minus assets like images) is under *half a megabyte* large. You could probably look at alpha.zero blogs on your Dreamcast.<br>
Also, we could add whatever we'd like here without worrying about some "tweet limit" or whatever.
<br><br><br>
Yeah, right. I also got to release my first track today. <a href="https://1oolm.bandcamp.com/track/1-kije-3">1_KIJE^3</a>, formerly known as "X Cubed (Cubic Root Remix)". Last minute change because I realised X Cubed is kind of dead in the water right now.
<br><br>
Check it out if you wanna, it's at the price of free. Because sanctions. I can't even provide y'all the option to pay for it. <br> Use it in videos, listen at 10:54PM, whatever. It gets a bit nutty. <br>

"bass boosted" channels will still find their way
<br><br><br>
So, yeah! Hey guys. Enjoy your stay, and don't forget to give some feedback on this ordeal. <br><br>
