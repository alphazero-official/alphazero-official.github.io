Oops, it's been a while again. Have some content!<br>
NEWS FLASH: Welcome the legend Artem4ikBaik back into the game! Back after months, he's assisted me with this update already.
<br>
<br>
This time I:
- Released the track "Constraint" with Masernerd as Stretched Across Infinity, and updated his page to reflect the changes
- Added my Bandcamp page to the site footer (also added a header to said page while at it)
- Made the site footer more compact by cramming all social links into one line
- Made off-site links open in a new tab
- Moved the email listing to the same column as the rest of the social links
- Added more random rolling messages to the 404 page
