This is getting really boring

Today I:
- Added post unlisting. If the "unlisted" config is true, the post is not listed in searches, lists, etc. Link only! Simple as that.
- Hopefully fixed the searchbar and nav button being bad on mobile
- Added a new list pointer (![pointerr](/assets/image/list-pointer.gif)) that I made in 6 seconds. 
- Updated the <a href="/aisyfustugfyhjsdfsuhadfj">404 page</a> (now with a randomised message as well)
- Updated Contributors list to be an actual list instead of looking like a textwall
